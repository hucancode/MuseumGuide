Let’s start with the king: Tyrannosaurus rex means the “Tyrant Lizard King”, and you could hardly imagine a better name. It was named in 1905 by Henry Fairfield Osborn, who was then the president of the American Museum of Natural History.

T-Rex, as it is often called, lived in the late Cretaceous, the very last period when dinosaurs ruled the Earth. Although it seems that T-Rex “only” lived for 2 million years (a relatively short period, compared to other dinosaurs), it made quite an impact.

It’s one of the largest known land predators and is estimated to have had the strongest bite among all terrestrial animals. However, while T-Rex was likely an apex predator, it might have also been a scavenger. To this day, the debate about whether he was purely a hunter of also scavenged is one of the most heated in the world of paleontology.

From here on, we will focus on a genus of dinosaurs instead of individual species, but we thought we’d give T-Rex a category of its own.
