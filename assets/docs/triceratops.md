Unlike the Stegosaur, the Triceratops was actually contemporary with the T-Rex, so the two might have encountered each other. Alas, one can only imagine what impression the first Triceratops skull made on its discoverers. A massive, tank-like dinosaur boasting three devil-like horns on its armored head must have been quite the sight. However, while the Triceratops was probably not the most gentle of dinosaurs (fossil findings suggest that it regularly engaged in fights with predators and other members of its species), it was still an herbivore.

The Triceratops is one of the last known true dinosaurs, becoming extict 66 million years ago. Its name literally means “three-horned-face”. Its sturdy, robust body meant not only that the Triceratops was not an easy prey — but also that many examples have been preserved as fossils, allowing paleontologists to study the species in relative detail. Its fossils are among the most common dinosaur fossils in the late Cretaceous.
